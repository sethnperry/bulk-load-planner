// app/admin/FleetUtilizationModal.tsx
//
// Phase 3 of the payload-utilization system: the fleet view, replacing
// UnderloadingDashboardModal.tsx. See docs/incentive-redesign-plan.md.
//
// This file is the data half only; the presentation lives in
// FleetUtilizationView.tsx so it can be rendered outside a browser.
//
// The concept is unchanged from the benchmark-era dashboard it replaces --
// "how much capacity is this fleet leaving on the table" -- but the data
// source is completely different, and three things follow from that:
//
//  1. NO `incentive_settings.enabled` GATE. The old dashboard showed a "turn
//     Incentives on and set a benchmark" empty state, because without a
//     manager-entered benchmark there was genuinely nothing to compute. The
//     capacity engine needs no benchmark and no configuration at all, and the
//     spec is explicit (sections 9/21, TEST K) that measurement must never
//     read `enabled`. A company that has configured nothing still gets real
//     numbers here.
//
//  2. NOT A LEADERBOARD (spec section 17). The per-driver table is sorted by
//     NAME, never by score, and carries no rank. This deliberately reverses
//     the old dashboard's own "sorted by gallons desc, not alphabetical -- a
//     leaderboard framing fits the number that justifies the subscription"
//     decision. Utilization is shaped by dispatch, terminal allocation and
//     equipment as much as by the driver, so ranking drivers on it produces a
//     blame chart wearing a scoreboard's clothes.
//
//  3. EXCLUDED LOADS ARE SHOWN, NEVER FOLDED IN (sections 10/11). A load over
//     the legal limit, or capped by someone else, cannot raise or lower the
//     fleet number. It surfaces as its own count so the figure above it stays
//     honest about what it does and doesn't cover.
//
// Audience is admin + lead + dispatch, unchanged from the dashboard it
// replaces -- enforced by load_utilization_staff_read (is_company_staff),
// not by this component.
