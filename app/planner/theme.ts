// Planner-screen theming: light mode is the original all-white top section
// (header/tab-bar) + white Load button + white compartment handles + light
// CG-slider puck. Dark mode swaps that same set of elements to a graphite
// fill, with icon/tab/button text flipping light. A custom accent color (if
// set) overrides the fill for those same elements regardless of dark/light
// -- but per the user's explicit choice, text/icon colors always follow the
// dark/light setting only, never the accent color itself.

// caller passes its OWN current light-mode color (they aren't all the same
// shade today -- e.g. the CG puck is "#d9d9d9", not pure white) so light
// mode stays pixel-identical to "what we have now"; dark mode is the one
// that unifies all of them to a single graphite, and a custom accent color
// overrides either.

// (CalculatorLayoutClient.tsx) now uses a flat black background matching
// the page body exactly ("turn the background black so it looks like
// there's no header"), not a themed gradient.

// (CalculatorLayoutClient.tsx's TabBar), deleted along with it once every
// destination it held moved into NavMenu's own dropdown instead.
