// Rack-aware loading (see CLAUDE.md "rack-aware loading" discussion,
// 2026-08-16): before this, a terminal's actual observed API/temp readings
// pooled into one shared number regardless of which physical rack a driver
// was actually at -- two racks at the same terminal with genuinely
// different readings would silently blend together. This sheet forces a
// rack pick whenever a terminal has more than one rack (see
// CalculatorShellContext.tsx's chooseTerminal, which decides whether to
// even open this -- a 0- or 1-rack terminal never shows it at all).
//
// Deliberately has no "skip" option: an unresolved rack pick would mean
// this load's actual API/temp has nowhere correct to write, silently
// falling back to the same terminal-wide pooling this whole feature exists
// to fix. Backdrop tap / Escape do nothing (FullscreenModal's onClose isn't
// used here on purpose) -- picking a row is the only way out.

// Restyled 2026-09-05, per explicit direction ("all these windows... need
// our themed color treatment and not have the generic grey hue") -- this
// sheet was still the flat #111518/rgba(255,255,255,0.05) look every other
// bottom sheet in the app (CancelLoadSheet, PresetActionSheet) already
// moved off of; now matches CancelLoadSheet's own GRAPHITE-gradient sheet +
// CARD_BG/CARD_BORDER/CARD_SHADOW row treatment exactly, since it now also
// appears as part of the mid-load terminal-switch flow (page.tsx) where
// the two would otherwise sit right next to each other looking inconsistent.
