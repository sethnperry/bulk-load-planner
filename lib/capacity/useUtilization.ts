/**
 * Fleet headroom: what a safely-raised company target would unlock (see the
 * plan's section 4a). Reads the capacity snapshots rather than
 * load_utilization, because headroom is a property of what the equipment
 * could have carried, not of how well the driver did.
 *
 * Never shown to a driver -- their score must not move because of a
 * company-level decision they had no part in.
 *
 * TWO queries, not a PostgREST embed. `load_capacity_snapshot` and
 * `load_utilization` both have a foreign key to `load_log` and none to each
 * other, so `load_utilization?select=...,load_capacity_snapshot(...)` is not
 * an embeddable relationship: PostgREST answers PGRST200 ("could not find a
 * relationship"), verified against production. Going through load_utilization
 * first is still necessary rather than querying snapshots directly, because
 * `load_capacity_snapshot` carries no company_id of its own -- company
 * scoping only exists on the utilization row.
 *
 * Only ELIGIBLE loads contribute. Not a scoring decision -- headroom is not a
 * score -- but an excluded_incomplete_data load is one whose capacity could
 * not be established, so its snapshot can read 0 available against a real
 * legal figure and manufacture headroom out of a measurement failure. That
 * would inflate the exact number used to argue for raising a company's weight
 * target, which is the one direction this must never overstate. Restricting to
 * eligible loads also keeps this figure comparable with the utilization
 * percentage shown beside it, which covers the same loads.
